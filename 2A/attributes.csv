Attribute,Type,Note
DryWeight,Quantitative,This measurement tells us what the weight of dry biomass is for each specific observation
PlotID,Categorical,This descriptor is a unique ID that tells us which randomized point we sampled 
Quadrat,Categorical,"There are 5 quadrats that we sample for each quadrat (20,40,60,80,100)"
spp_code,Categorical,"These are unique codes that describe the family, genius and species for every item observed"
pheno,Categorical,"Each species is assigned a growth stage when we observe it - New, Budding, Flowering, Fruiting, Mature or Cured (N, B, FL, FR, M, C)"
PVT,Categorical,"This number describes the vegetation community that was being sampled, we have 5 total for the study area, it is used as part of the descriptor for each plotID"
composition_ID,Categorical,"This unique ID helps link the biomass and aerial percent cover to specific plots and quadrats, rather than just the species and phenology stage"
percent,Quantitative,This measurement tells us the percent cover that each composition_id occupies within a 1x1m quadrat
spp_id,Categorical,This unique ID is slightly more broad and will be used to identify species/phenology combinations within each vegetation type as well as the season
Family,Categorical,This will be used to group quality data if we do not have enough information to determine the quality down to the smaller scale (genus)
Genus,Categorical,This will be used to group quality data if we do not have enough information to determine the quality down to the smaller scale (spp)
Spp,Categorical,This will be used to group quality data if we do not have enough information to determine the quality down to the smaller scale (phenological stage)
CommonName,Categorical,"This is another identifier for each species, it will likely not be used within the analysis so it could be removed"
Duration,Categorical,This is another category I may use to group quality data based on the growth duration of each species
Status,Categorical,Each species is categorized as native or invasive
Season,Categorical,"Our observations are grouped based on the date that they were sampled (Spring, Summer and Fall) to observe the changes in nutritional quality"
Date,Categorical,This keeps track of the day that each observation was sampled
Aspect,Categorical,Described the direction the hill was facing that each of our transects had been sampled on
Elev,Quantitative,Describes the elevation that each of the transects was sampled at
Lat/Long,Categorical,"Each of the lat/long pairs plots the beginning, middle and end of each of the transects "
Moved,Categorical,Tells us whether the orginal randomized point had to be moved
